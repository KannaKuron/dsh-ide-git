/**
 * dsh-ide-git — commit-graph layout test (the client's branch lane algorithm).
 *
 * The graph is drawn per row, but the lanes are decided by a single pass in
 * `buildRows`: a lane is a slot that carries one pending commit downwards
 * until that commit's own row consumes it. That makes the layout checkable
 * without a browser — the function is pure and depends on nothing but its
 * argument, so it is lifted straight out of the client half and driven here.
 *
 * The invariant that matters is "no ghost lane": whatever a row leaves on a
 * lane must be the commit that lane is holding, so the commit has to show up
 * later on THAT lane. v0.4.1 fixed the case where a branch merging back into a
 * lane to its left parked its first parent on its own lane anyway, leaving a
 * stub of a fork that never happened.
